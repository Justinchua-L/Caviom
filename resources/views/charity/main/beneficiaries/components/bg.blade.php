<textarea class="form-control" rows="5" name="about_family">A typical low-income family in the United States is a mother and one or two children. An average day for such a family starts early, with the mother feeding the children before they start school. The children usually do their homework, sometimes even while going on a field trip to see another school. After school they play sports and engage in hobbies before enjoying a meal with their families. Following this meal comes a long day of relaxation or watching TV as everyone enjoys downtime together.</textarea>
