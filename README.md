## About Caviom

Caviom is a platform for Charitable Organizations to collaborate with their fellow volunteers or co-worker at the comfort of their own space. The platform helps them easen the digitalization of their records and processes without breaking the bank. 

## Creating an Account

Users can register on [this page (still in-development)](https://caviom.miguellumbao.com/register). They can create one (1) Charitable Organization where they belong to, and invite anyone in the org using Free *Star Tokens* (Caviom's digital currency).

## On-going Development

We thank you for your support and interest. We are currently working on Caviom, but please feel free to contact us if you have any comments, questions and/or suggestions. Follow our development progress on [Github](https://github.com/josephmiguelchan/Caviom).
